## Tips

### How To Create Markdown Lists

- If you are like me, using lists to write instructions is a must. As a result, I decided to write a short summary of how to incorporate lists using line breaks when answer the prompts.
- This entire README markdown was written using this method.

  - Line Break: { 0 }

  - Line Break + Indent Level 1: { 0 }{ 1 }

  - Line Break + Indent Level 2: { 0 }{ 2 }

- Explanation: When using the command line and you want to create a single line break, incorporate { 0 } at the beginning of the sentence where you want to have a line break.
- Please note, since I used this technique to write this document, I had to use extra space between the curly brackets and the numbers as to not trigger an indent. Therefore, when you do use this method just remove the extra space between the curly brackets and the numbers.

VS Code Preview

- One efficiency tips when writing README files was utilizing VS Codes preview markdown feature. This feature allows you to preview how your markdown files before having to upload to see the final output.

  - Shortcut To Preview: CMD + Shift + V
